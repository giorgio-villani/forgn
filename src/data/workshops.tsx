    instructor: 'Peter Broz',
    description:
      'This 7 week course offers an in depth look at painting portraits in oil using a direct painting method, also known as alla prima. This method allows the artist to paint more efficiently by strategically placing opaque colors on the canvas, resulting in a completed painting using a single layer of paint. The alla prima technique eliminates the need for underpainting or glazing. In addition to working faster and more efficiently, less or even no solvent is needed during the painting process. The zorn palette offers a convenient and versatile way to create an array of hues and skin tones using just four colors. By adopting a limited color palette, color mixing is made more approachable and easier to understand. As we will be focusing mainly on painting, this course will be best fit for students with a solid foundation in drawing. We will work from both printed reference material as well as live models.',
